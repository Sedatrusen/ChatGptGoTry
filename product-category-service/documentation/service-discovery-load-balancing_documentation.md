# service discovery load balancing Documentation

## Overview
The service discovery load balancing service is responsible for providing functionality related to [insert purpose here, e.g., product categories, product catalog, authentication, etc.].

## Features
- [List key features here]

## Architecture
The service discovery load balancing service follows a microservices architecture. It interacts with other services in the system via RESTful APIs. It may utilize a database for data storage and caching mechanisms for performance optimization.

## Endpoints
The following endpoints are exposed by the service discovery load balancing service:
- GET /categories: Retrieve all product categories.
- POST /categories: Create a new product category.
- GET /categories/{id}: Retrieve a specific product category by ID.
- PUT /categories/{id}: Update a product category.
- DELETE /categories/{id}: Delete a product category by ID.

- [List configuration options and their descriptions here]

## Deployment
To deploy the service discovery load balancing service:
1. Build the Docker image: 
2. Run the Docker container: 

## Testing
The service discovery load balancing service is tested using both unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests cover individual functions and components, while integration tests ensure that the service functions correctly within the larger system. We use [insert testing framework here, e.g., Go's testing package, Jest, etc.] for testing.

## Security
Security measures implemented in the service discovery load balancing service include:
- Input validation to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.

## Monitoring and Logging
The service discovery load balancing service is monitored and logged using [insert monitoring/logging tools here, e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, etc.]. We track service health, performance metrics, and errors to ensure optimal functioning.

## Maintenance
To maintain the service discovery load balancing service:
- Regularly update dependencies and libraries to address security vulnerabilities.
- Monitor system performance and scale resources as needed.
- Implement versioning and release management practices to ensure smooth updates and deployments.
